### Conclusion

This project explored the relationship between GDP and life expectancy at birth across multiple countries and years. Data from a CSV file was loaded into a DataFrame for analysis. Various visualizations and calculations were performed between GDP, life expectancy, year, and country — including logarithmic scales to improve visibility across wide economic ranges.

The analysis suggests that GDP and life expectancy are positively correlated but exhibit a point of diminishing returns. Beyond a certain threshold, increases in GDP yield smaller improvements in life expectancy. Negative GDP growth does not necessarily lead to shorter life spans, especially over short timeframes. This implies that while GDP influences health indirectly through factors such as technology and medical care, it is not a direct predictor of life expectancy on a year-to-year basis.

The dataset was largely complete, requiring only minor column renaming and formatting. Exploratory analysis confirmed a strong overall correlation between GDP and life expectancy, more pronounced than with time alone. However, further investigation into average GDP growth rates and their derivatives revealed that the relationship weakens at higher income levels.

Future analysis could integrate additional variables such as healthcare spending, access to medical services, and technological innovation to identify more direct determinants of life expectancy. This project strengthened my ability to visualize and interpret complex data, refine visual presentation using hues, loops, and log scales, and apply statistical reasoning through tools like `lmplot`.
